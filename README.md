# Product Store Website with MockAPI

This is a simple e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, integrated with MockAPI to manage a product catalog, shopping cart, and order history. The website prompts for a MockAPI project ID on load to fetch data from your MockAPI project.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays products with name, description, price, and image, with an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Cart**: Shows items with quantities, allows updating quantities or removing items, and supports checkout.
- **Order History**: Lists past orders with item details and totals.
- **API Key Prompt**: Requires a MockAPI project ID to access the API, stored in `localStorage` for convenience.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- An account on [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io/).
- A static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) or a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) to run the website.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a MockAPI Account and Project

1. **Sign Up**:

   - Visit [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io/) and click "Sign Up" to create an account.
   - Provide your email and a password, or sign up using GitHub/Google.
   - Verify your email if prompted.

2. **Create a New Project**:

   - Log in to your MockAPI dashboard.
   - Click **New Project** in the top-right corner.
   - Enter a project name (e.g., `OrderSystem`) and click **Create**.
   - Enter a prefix named by `ordersystem` in smal letters.
   - MockAPI will generate a unique **Project ID** (a 16-character hexadecimal string, e.g., `6819a7471ac1155635058d79`).
   - Note the project base URL, which will be `https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/`. This is used to access your API.

3. **Copy the Project ID**:
   - In the MockAPI dashboard, select your project.
   - The project ID is visible in the URL or project settings (e.g., `6819a7471ac1155635058d79`).
   - Save this ID; it will be used as the "API key" in the website.

### Step 2: Set Up Resources

You need to create two resources in your MockAPI project: `Products` and `Orders`.

#### Resource 1: Products

1. In your project dashboard, click **New Resource**.
2. Name the resource `products` (lowercase, plural).
3. Define the following fields:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "string",
     "name": "string",
     "productImage": "url",
     "price": "string",
     "description": "string",
     "createdAt": "date"
   }
   ```
   - Example field settings:
     - `id`: Auto-generated by MockAPI.
     - `name`: Use "Faker > Name > Full Name" or manually enter product names (e.g., "Pizza").
     - `productImage`: Use "Faker > Image > Image URL" or a valid image URL (e.g., `https://via.placeholder.com/150`).
     - `price`: Enter a number as a string (e.g., `"556.29"`).
     - `description`: Use "Faker > Lorem > Sentence" or a custom description.
     - `createdAt`: Use "Faker > Date > Past".
4. Generate sample data:
   - Click **Generate Data** and create at least 2-3 sample products.
   - Example product:
     ```json
     {
       "createdAt": "2025-05-05T11:42:34.632Z",
       "name": "Kenny Nikolaus",
       "productImage": "https://loremflickr.com/898/911?lock=7001932265550359",
       "price": "556.29",
       "description": "Discover the flamingo-like agility of our Pizza, perfect for meaty users",
       "id": "1"
     }
     ```
5. Save the resource.

#### Resource 2: Orders

1. Click **New Resource** again.
2. Name the resource `order` (lowercase, singular).
3. Define the following fields:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "string",
     "total": "number",
     "date": "date"
   }
   ```
   - Example field settings:
     - `id`: Auto-generated by MockAPI.

- `total`: Use "Faker > Number > Number" or leave empty (website calculates it).
  - `date`: Use "Faker > Date > Past" or leave empty.

4. Optionally generate sample orders for testing, or leave empty (the website will create orders via checkout).
5. Save the resource.

### Step 3: Test MockAPI Endpoints

1. Use a browser or a tool like Postman to test your API:
   - **Products**: `GET https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/ordersystem/products`
     - Should return a list of products (e.g., the sample data above).
   - **Orders**: `POST https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/ordersystem/orders`
     - Test with a sample payload:
       ```json
       {
         "total": 556.29,
         "date": "2025-05-07T10:00:00Z"
       }
       ```
     - Ensure the order is created and retrievable via `GET https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/ordersystem/orders`.
2. If endpoints fail, check your project ID and resource names (`products`, `orders`).

### Troubleshooting

- **Modal Doesnâ€™t Close**:
  - Ensure the project ID is 16 hexadecimal characters (e.g., `6819a7471ac1155635058d79`).
  - Check the browser console (`Ctrl+Shift+J`) for errors.
- **Products Not Loading**:
  - Verify `https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/ordersystem/products` returns data.
  - Ensure the `products` resource exists and has data.
- **Checkout Fails**:
  - Confirm `https://<project-id>.mockapi.io/ordersystem/orders` accepts POST requests.
  - Check for network or CORS errors in the console.
- **Invalid Images**:
  - Ensure `productImage` URLs in the `products` resource are valid.
  - Replace with placeholders (e.g., `https://via.placeholder.com/150`) if needed.
- **Reset API Key**:
  - Clear `localStorage` by running `localStorage.removeItem('mockapi_project_id')` in the console or clicking "Change API Key".
